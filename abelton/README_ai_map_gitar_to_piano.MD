### ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Basics: Low E String (6th string) Frets 0 to 7

- The open 6th string (**fret 0**) is **E2**.
- Each fret increases the pitch by a **semitone** (half-step).
- So, frets 0â€“7 on the 6th string give you the following notes:

### ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Basics Step: A String (5th string) (Frets 0 to 7)

- The A string is the **5th string** on the guitar, and when played open (fret 0), it sounds the note **A**. 
- Each fret increases the pitch by a **semitone** (half step). 
- So, the notes from fret 0 to fret 7 are:

### âœ… Summary Table (Guitar Frets â†’ Piano Notes)

| Fret | Guitar Note | Piano Note |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 0    | A           | A2         |
| 1    | Aâ™¯ / Bâ™­     | Aâ™¯2 / Bâ™­2  |
| 2    | B           | B2         |
| 3    | C           | C3         |
| 4    | Câ™¯ / Dâ™­     | Câ™¯3 / Dâ™­3  |
| 5    | D           | D3         |
| 6    | Dâ™¯ / Eâ™­     | Dâ™¯3 / Eâ™­3  |
| 7    | E           | E3         |

So, each fret simply moves the note up by one semitone, and each note corresponds directly to a key on the piano.
