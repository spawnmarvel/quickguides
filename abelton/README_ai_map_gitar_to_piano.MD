# Guitar fretboard to piano fret 0 to 12

Mapping the **guitar fretboard to the piano keyboard** is a helpful way to understand music theory, note relationships, and how the same notes appear across different instruments.

## ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Fretboard to ðŸŽ¹ Piano Mapping

### 1. **Standard Guitar Tuning**
A standard 6-string guitar (from lowest to highest) is tuned as follows:

| String | Note | Octave |
|--------|------|--------|
| 6 | E | 2 |
| 5 | A | 2 |
| 4 | D | 3 |
| 3 | G | 3 |
| 2 | B | 3 |
| 1 | E | 4 |

> These are the **open string notes**. Fretting a string raises the pitch by a **semitone** per fret.

---

### 2. **Fretboard to Piano Mapping Example**

Letâ€™s take a few frets and map them to the piano keys.

#### Example: 6th String (Low E)

| Fret | Note | Piano Key (MIDI Note) |
|------|------|------------------------|
| 0 | E2 | E2 |
| 1 | F2 | F2 |
| 2 | F#2 | F#2 |
| 3 | G2 | G2 |
| 5 | A2 | A2 |
| 7 | B2 | B2 |
| 12 | E3 | E3 (1 octave higher) |

The same applies to other strings, just starting from their open note.

### 3. **How to Use This Mapping**

- Each fret = 1 semitone = 1 piano key (white or black).
- You can find any note on the guitar fretboard and locate it on the piano.
- This helps in:
  - Writing music across instruments
  - Understanding chords and scales
  - Ear training

### 4. **Visual Comparison Example**

Letâ€™s map a few notes from the guitar to piano:

#### ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Notes (String/Fret) â†’ ðŸŽ¹ Piano Notes

| Guitar (String/Fret) | Note | Piano Key |
|----------------------|------|------------|
| 6th / 0 | E2 | E2 |
| 5th / 0 | A2 | A2 |
| 4th / 2 | E3 | E3 |
| 3rd / 0 | G3 | G3 |
| 2nd / 1 | C4 | Middle C |
| 1st / 0 | E4 | E4 |
| 1st / 12 | E5 | E5 |

---

### 5. **Tip: Use a Note Finder**
If you're trying to map a specific fret on a specific string, you can:

1. Determine the **open string note**.
2. Add the number of **semitones** (frets).
3. Count up that many piano keys from the open string note.

---

### 6. **MIDI Note Numbers (Optional Advanced)**

| Note | Octave | MIDI Number |
|------|--------|-------------|
| E2 | 2 | 40 |
| A2 | 2 | 45 |
| D3 | 3 | 50 |
| G3 | 3 | 55 |
| B3 | 3 | 59 |
| E4 | 4 | 64 |

This is useful if doing digital music production (DAWs, MIDI programming, etc.).

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

- Each **guitar fret** = **1 piano key**.
- You can map any guitar note to a piano note by knowing the **open string pitch** and **counting semitones**.
- This mapping helps with theory, composition, and playing across instruments.

### ðŸŽ¯ How to Use This Chart

- **Find the string and fret** you're playing on the guitar.
- Look at the corresponding **note** in the chart.
- Thatâ€™s the **exact same note** on the piano.
- For example:
  - 2nd string, 1st fret = **C4** = **Middle C** on piano.
  - 6th string, 3rd fret = **G2** on piano.

###  What Are C1, C2, C3 on Piano?
These refer to specific octaves of the note C on an 88-key piano keyboard.

ðŸŽ¼ Each C note starts a new octave and is labeled accordingly:

Note	Description	MIDI #	Frequency
C1	Very low C (far left of piano)	24	~32.7 Hz
C2	Low C	36	~65.4 Hz
C3	Low-mid C	48	~130.8 Hz
C4	Middle C ðŸŽ¯	60	~261.6 Hz
C5	One octave above middle C	72	~523.3 Hz
C6	High C	84	~1046.5 Hz
C7	Very high C	96	~2093 Hz
C8	Highest C (top of piano)	108	~4186 Hz


How This Relates to Guitar
Guitar String	Open Note	Piano Equivalent
6th (Low E)	E2	Very low E note
5th (A)	A2	Below middle C
4th (D)	D3	Below middle C
3rd (G)	G3	Below middle C
2nd (B)	B3	Just below middle C
1st (High E)	E4	Middle C is C4, so E4 is just above
