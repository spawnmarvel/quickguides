### ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Basics: Low E String (6th string)

- The open 6th string (**fret 0**) is **E2**.
- Each fret increases the pitch by a **semitone** (half-step).
- So, frets 0â€“7 on the 6th string give you the following notes:

| Fret | Note | Piano Key | MIDI Note # |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| 0    | E2   | E below the bass clef | 40 |
| 1    | F2   | F             | 41 |
| 2    | Fâ™¯2 / Gâ™­2 | F#/Gb     | 42 |
| 3    | G2   | G             | 43 |
| 4    | Gâ™¯2 / Aâ™­2 | G#/Ab     | 44 |
| 5    | A2   | A             | 45 |
| 6    | Aâ™¯2 / Bâ™­2 | A#/Bb     | 46 |
| 7    | B2   | B             | 47 |

### ðŸŽ¹ Finding These Notes on Piano

- The **lowest E on a standard 88-key piano** is **E1**, but the guitar's low E string starts at **E2**, which is the **second E from the left** on the piano.
- Here's how to find the notes on the piano:

#### Piano Location Guide:
- **E2**: Second E from the far left
- Then go up one semitone for each fret

### ðŸŽ§ Tip:
If you have a MIDI keyboard or piano app, try pressing the keys from **E2 to B2** â€” those will match the pitches played on the low E string from fret 0 to 7.
