# Guitar fretboard to piano keys

## Guitar strings

* E, low
* Ad
* D
* G
* B
* E, high

Mapping the low E string of a guitar (6th string) from **fret 0 to fret 7** to **piano keys** involves understanding the relationship between guitar frets and musical notes, then finding those notes on the piano.

### ðŸŽ¸ Guitar Basics: Low E String (6th string)

- The open 6th string (**fret 0**) is **E2**.
- Each fret increases the pitch by a **semitone** (half-step).
- So, frets 0â€“7 on the 6th string give you the following notes:

| Fret | Note | Piano Key | MIDI Note # |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| 0    | E2   | E below the bass clef | 40 |
| 1    | F2   | F             | 41 |
| 2    | Fâ™¯2 / Gâ™­2 | F#/Gb     | 42 |
| 3    | G2   | G             | 43 |
| 4    | Gâ™¯2 / Aâ™­2 | G#/Ab     | 44 |
| 5    | A2   | A             | 45 |
| 6    | Aâ™¯2 / Bâ™­2 | A#/Bb     | 46 |
| 7    | B2   | B             | 47 |

### ðŸŽ¹ Finding These Notes on Piano

- The **lowest E on a standard 88-key piano** is **E1**, but the guitar's low E string starts at **E2**, which is the **second E from the left** on the piano.
- Here's how to find the notes on the piano:

#### Piano Location Guide:
- **E2**: Second E from the far left
- Then go up one semitone for each fret

### âœ… Summary Table (Guitar Frets â†’ Piano Notes)

| Guitar Fret | Note Name | Piano Key (Starting from A0) |
|-------------|------------|------------------------------|
| 0           | E2         | 40th MIDI note               |
| 1           | F2         | 41                           |
| 2           | Fâ™¯2 / Gâ™­2  | 42                           |
| 3           | G2         | 43                           |
| 4           | Gâ™¯2 / Aâ™­2  | 44                           |
| 5           | A2         | 45                           |
| 6           | Aâ™¯2 / Bâ™­2  | 46                           |
| 7           | B2         | 47                           |

### ðŸŽ§ Tip:
If you have a MIDI keyboard or piano app, try pressing the keys from **E2 to B2** â€” those will match the pitches played on the low E string from fret 0 to 7.

Mapping the A string (5th string) of a guitar from fret 0 to fret 7 to piano keys involves understanding how notes progress on the guitar and how they correspond to notes on the piano.

---

### ðŸŽ¸ Step 1: Understand the Notes on the A String (Frets 0 to 7)

The A string is the **5th string** on the guitar, and when played open (fret 0), it sounds the note **A**. Each fret increases the pitch by a **semitone** (half step). So, the notes from fret 0 to fret 7 are:

| Fret | Note |
|------|------|
| 0    | A    |
| 1    | Aâ™¯ / Bâ™­ |
| 2    | B    |
| 3    | C    |
| 4    | Câ™¯ / Dâ™­ |
| 5    | D    |
| 6    | Dâ™¯ / Eâ™­ |
| 7    | E    |

---

### ðŸŽ¹ Step 2: Find These Notes on the Piano

Now, weâ€™ll map each of these notes to their corresponding piano keys. On a standard-tuned guitar, the open A string (fret 0) is **A2** (the A below middle C, which is C4 on the piano).

So the mapping becomes:

| Fret | Guitar Note | Piano Note |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 0    | A           | A2         |
| 1    | Aâ™¯ / Bâ™­     | Aâ™¯2 / Bâ™­2  |
| 2    | B           | B2         |
| 3    | C           | C3         |
| 4    | Câ™¯ / Dâ™­     | Câ™¯3 / Dâ™­3  |
| 5    | D           | D3         |
| 6    | Dâ™¯ / Eâ™­     | Dâ™¯3 / Eâ™­3  |
| 7    | E           | E3         |

So, each fret simply moves the note up by one semitone, and each note corresponds directly to a key on the piano.

### ðŸŽ¯ Summary

To map the A string from fret 0 to 7 to piano keys:

- Know the starting pitch: **A2**
- Move up by semitones (1 per fret)
- Match each resulting note to its piano key
