Then we have the interface for input and sound from gitar or INST 1

![Focusrite control](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/abelton/Focusrite/images/focusrite_control.jpg)

Yes, sound from gitar now


## Connect to Abelton

After you have sound from the headphones on focusrite and the jack for gitar is in track 1

Buffer size

![Buffer size](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/abelton/Focusrite/images/buffer_size.jpg)


Low vs high buffer

For start use a high buffer size 512.

On Windows, the Buffer Size or Sample Rate in the Audio tab of Ableton Live's Preferences may appear greyed out. This usually means you need to adjust this setting in the interface's own control software.

Have to use the Focusrite control interface I guess


![Buffer low ws high](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/abelton/Focusrite/images/buffer_low_high.jpg)

Here we have changed it.

![Focusrite change buffer](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/abelton/Focusrite/images/focusrite_change_buffer_size.jpg)


On windows https://support.focusrite.com/hc/en-gb/articles/208814065-How-to-Change-Sample-Rate-Buffer-Size-Settings-on-Windows

Now check abelton, to verify new buffer.

## Recording audio in Ableton Live

Connect jack gitar, set input to INST mode. (red light on INST)

Open focusrite and set Line to INST mode

![Focusrite control](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/abelton/Focusrite/images/focusrite_control.jpg)

Now play a bit, but ensure that the halo is green (not red or yellow, adjust it).

The sound was missing due to the input on focusrite was sensitive, just took it out and half way in perfect.

(Check sound and speakers, now it is Speakers (2 - Focusrite USB Audio))

Maybe change the input thing to one with gold?

Press direct monitoring so the latency will be smooth, ref buffer size

Connect you headset on turn down monitor.

Open Abelton and verify settings

![Abelton verify](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/abelton/Focusrite/images/abelton_verify.jpg)

Remove the two default midi track if they are not needed.

You now have two audio tracks.

![Two Audio](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/abelton/Focusrite/images/two_audio.jpg)

Then go the arrangemnt view, and rename the audio track to your input type.

![Arr view](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/abelton/Focusrite/images/arr_view.jpg)

Since we mapped the focusrite INST 1 to gitar, we we use input 1 on the audio track we named Guitar Ibanez

![Guitar_input_1_1](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/abelton/Focusrite/images/guitar_input_1_1.jpg)


The sound was missing due to the input on focusrite was sensitive, just took it out and half way in perfect.

(Check sound and speakers, now it is Speakers (2 - Focusrite USB Audio))

Now when you have sound, adjust the moitor on focusrite, to zero, all the way to the left.


Make a kick drum and play guitar
