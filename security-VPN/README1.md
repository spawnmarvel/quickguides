# Remote work using Azure VPN Gateway Point-to-site

A Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN gateway connection lets you create a secure connection to your virtual network from an individual client computer.

Azure supports three types of Point-to-site VPN options:

* Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP). SSTP is a Microsoft proprietary SSL-based solution that can penetrate firewalls since most firewalls open the outbound TCP port that 443 SSL uses.
* OpenVPN. OpenVPN is a SSL-based solution that can penetrate firewalls since most firewalls open the outbound TCP port that 443 SSL uses.
* IKEv2 VPN. IKEv2 VPN is a standards-based IPsec VPN solution that uses outbound UDP ports 500 and 4500 and IP protocol no. 50. Firewalls don't always open these ports, so there's a possibility of IKEv2 VPN not being able to traverse proxies and firewalls.

* Auto-reconnect is a function of the client being used. Windows supports auto-reconnect by configuring the Always On VPN client feature.
