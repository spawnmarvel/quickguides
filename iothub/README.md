* Device-to-cloud messages
* Cloud-to-device commands
* IoT Edge
* Device twin
* Daily message limit up to 8000
* Message size 0.5 KB
Public Access
Permission model Shared access policy + RBAC
Device-to-cloud partitions, default 2
* The number of partitions relates the device-to-cloud messages to the number of simultaneous readers of these messages. Most IoT hubs only need 4 partions.
