Great tutorial, thanks Microsoft and Alvaro Videla Godoy.

Topology

![Topology ](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/eventhub/images/topology.jpg)

Case:
* Imagine you have sensor data thatâ€™s being sent to RabbitMQ from various IoT devices. These devices capture temperature and humidity readings. 
* Getting the data out of RabbitMQ and into Azure. Using Azure Event Hubs, you can bridge RabbitMQ.

Queue example:
* telemetry01

Example json:

```json
{
    "Timestamp": <Timestamp>, 
    "Temperature": <Temperature>, 
    "Humidity": <Humidity>
}

```
Send data using shovel plugin,  AMQP 1.0 protocol supported both by RabbitMQ and Event Hubs.

Create an event hub:
* Create a resource group
* Create Event Hubs namespace
* Create event hub

### Create an Event Hubs namespace: amqps2azure

### Create an event hub: event-amqps-telemetry01

Scaling with Event Hubs

There are two factors which influence scaling with Event Hubs.
* Throughput units (standard tier) or processing units (premium tier)
* Partitions

The throughput capacity of Event Hubs is controlled by throughput units. Throughput units are pre-purchased units of capacity. A single throughput unit lets you:
* Ingress: Up to 1 MB per second or 1000 events per second (whichever comes first).
* Egress: Up to 2 MB per second or 4096 events per second.


Partitions
* Event Hubs organizes sequences of events sent to an event hub into one or more partitions. As newer events arrive, they're added to the end of this sequence.

### Create a Shared Access Signature for Event Hubs

A shared access signature (SAS) provides secure delegated access to resources.

Go to the event hub, event-amqps-telemetry01 , and in the left panel click on Shared Access Policies.

![SAS ](https://github.com/spawnmarvel/quickguides/blob/main/eventhub/images/sas.jpg)

### Connecting RabbitMQ to Event Hubs

Once the SAS key has been created, select it, and copy to the clipboard the one called Connection string-primary key.


```cmd
# Connection string 
Endpoint=sb://<your-namespace.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=send-event-amqps;SharedAccessKey=<SharedAccessKey>=;EntityPath=event-amqps-telemetry01

# RabbitMQ shovel format
amqps://send-event-amqps:<SharedAccessKey>@<your-namespace>.servicebus.windows.net:5671/?sasl=plain
```

We must convert it, there is a tool for it, https://red-mushroom-0f7446a0f.azurestaticapps.net/, but it seems like the signs that must be changed is in the SAS for, / to % for RabbitMQ.
