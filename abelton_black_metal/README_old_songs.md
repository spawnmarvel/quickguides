# A list of top 10 old norse songs without copywright

Finding top old Norse songs that are completely free of copyright is challenging because most recorded versions, arrangements, and performances are protected by copyright. However, **public domain** works—those whose copyrights have expired or were never copyrighted—can be used freely. Traditional Norse songs and poems often fall into the public domain, but you should be cautious about specific recordings and arrangements. Below is a list of 10 traditional Old Norse songs and poems that are in the public domain. Note that while the melodies and texts are public domain, specific modern recordings or arrangements may not be.

# what are the chordes for thoose songs?

Traditional Old Norse songs and poems, such as those found in the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda, do not come with standardised chords as they were originally intended to be sung in a monophonic (single melody line) style, often accompanied by instruments like the lyre or lute. These ancient compositions do not have harmonised chords in the modern sense.

However, modern interpreters and folk musicians have created harmonisations and chord progressions for these traditional texts. Since there is no single “correct” set of chords for these ancient songs, I'll provide a generic approach to harmonising a traditional Norse melody using modal scales commonly found in Norse music. One frequently used scale is the Dorian mode.

Let's take a hypothetical traditional Norse melody and harmonise it using D Dorian mode. The D Dorian scale consists of the notes: D, E, F, G, A, B, C.

### Example Harmonisation in D Dorian

1. **D minor (i)**
        - Notes: D F A
        - Chord: Dm

2.  **E diminished (ii°)**
        - Notes: E G Bb
        - Chord: Edim or E°

3. **F major (III)**
        - Notes: F A C
        - Chord: F

4. **G minor (iv)**
        - Notes: G Bb D
        - Chord: Gm

5. **A minor (v)**
        - Notes: A C E
        - Chord: Am
        
6. **Bb major (VI)**
        - Notes: Bb D F
        - Chord: Bb

7. **C major (VII)**
        - Notes: C E G
        - Chord: C

### Sample Chord Progression

A simple chord progression in D Dorian might be:

**Dm - F - Gm - C**

### Applying to a Hypothetical Melody

Let’s say we have a simple melody line in D Dorian:

```
D  E  F  G  A  G  F  E  D
```

A possible chord accompaniment could be:

```
| Dm  | F   | Gm  | C  |
| D   | E   | F   | G  | A  | G  | F  | E  | D  |
```

### Another Example in A Dorian

The A Dorian scale consists of the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F#, G.

1. **A minor (i)**
        - Notes: A C E
        - Chord: Am

2.  **B minor (ii)**
        - Notes: B D F#
        - Chord: Bm

3. **C major (III)**
        - Notes: C E G
        - Chord: C

4. **D minor (iv)**
        - Notes: D F A
        - Chord: Dm

5. **E minor (v)**
        - Notes: E G B
        - Chord Am

6. **F# major (VI)**
        - Notes: F# A# C#
        - Chord: F#

7. **G major (VII)**
        - Notes: G B D
        - Chord: G


### Sample Chord Progression

**Am - C - Dm - G**

### Applying to a Hypothetical Melody

For a melody line in A Dorian:

```
A  B  C  D  E  D  C  B  A
```

A possible chord accompaniment could be:

```
| Am  | C   | Dm  | G  |
| A   | B   | C   | D  | E  | D  | C  | B  | A  |
```

### Conclusion

These are just examples of how you might harmonise traditional Norse melodies using modal scales. The actual chords will vary depending on the specific melody and the interpreter's choices. For authentic traditional performances, it's best to consult arrangements by experts in Norse music or recordings by folk ensembles specialising in this repertoire.

# is there a sad scale on piano`?


While there isn't a specific "sad scale" on the piano, certain scales and keys are often used to evoke sad or melancholic emotions in music. The emotional character of a piece of music is influenced by a combination of factors including scale, mode, harmony, melody, rhythm, and tempo. Here are some scales and modes commonly associated with sad or emotive music:

1. **Minor Scales:**
   - **Natural Minor Scale:** This is the most straightforward minor scale and is often used to convey sadness. For example, C natural minor (C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B, C).
   - **Harmonic Minor Scale:** This scale has a raised 7th degree, which adds a bit of tension and can enhance the emotional impact. For example, C harmonic minor (C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B, C). 
   - **Melodic Minor Scale:** It has raised 6th and 7th degrees when ascending and reverts to the natural minor when descending. For example, C melodic minor ascending (C, D, Eb, F, G, A, B, C) and descending (C, B, Ab, G, F, Eb, D, C).

2.  **Modes:**
    - **Aeolian Mode:** This is essentially the natural minor scale. It starts on the 6th degree of the major scale. For example, A Aeolian is the same as C major starting on A (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A). 
    - **Locrian Mode:** This mode is quite sombre and tense due to its diminished 5th. It starts on the 7th degree of the major scale. For example, B Locrian derived from C major (B, C, D, E, F, G, Ab, B).
        - **Phrygian Mode:** It has a minor second degree, which gives it a mysterious and somewhat sad quality. It starts on the 3rd degree of the major scale. For example, E Phrygian derived from C major (E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E).

3. **Pentatonic Minor Scale:**
        - The minor pentatonic scale (e.g., A minor pentatonic: A, C, D, E, G) is often used in blues music, which frequently expresses sorrow and lamentation.  

4. **Harmony and Chords:**
        - **Minor Chords:** Chords built on minor scales such as minor triads (e.g., Cm, Am, Em) and minor 7th chords (e.g., Cm7, Am7) naturally sound more somber.
        - **Diminished Chords:** These chords have a tense, unresolved quality that can evoke sadness or anxiety (e.g., Cdim).
        - **Augmented Chords:** While less common for sadness, they can add an unsettling feeling when used sparingly.

5. **Slow Tempo and Dynamics:**
        - A slower tempo (adagio, largo) and softer dynamics (piano, pianissimo) also contribute to a sad atmosphere regardless of the scale used.

6. **Melodic Choices:**
        - Melodies that use stepwise motion, especially descending lines, often sound more melancholic. Large leaps can sound more joyous by contrast.  

In summary, while there is no single "sad scale," minor scales and modes, along with certain harmonic choices, tempos, and melodic lines, are commonly used to create a sad or melancholic mood in piano music.
