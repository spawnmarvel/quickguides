# A list of top 10 old norse songs without copywright

Finding top old Norse songs that are completely free of copyright is challenging because most recorded versions, arrangements, and performances are protected by copyright. However, **public domain** works—those whose copyrights have expired or were never copyrighted—can be used freely. Traditional Norse songs and poems often fall into the public domain, but you should be cautious about specific recordings and arrangements. Below is a list of 10 traditional Old Norse songs and poems that are in the public domain. Note that while the melodies and texts are public domain, specific modern recordings or arrangements may not be.
