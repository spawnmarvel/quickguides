## Natural Minor Scale on gitar with tabs


The Natural Minor Scale is one of the fundamental scales in music theory. It sounds melancholic, serious, or sometimes just a bit darker than a major scale.

#### Pattern 1: Root on the Low E String (5th Fret for A Minor)

This is often the first minor scale pattern guitarists learn. It's a very common "box" shape.

**A Natural Minor (Root at 5th Fret, Low E String)**

```
   1   4    <-- Fingers
D|-----------------------5--8---|
A|--------------------5--6--8---|
F|-----------------5--7---------|
C|--------------5--7------------|
G|-----------5--7--8------------|
C|--5--8------------------------|
   (Root)
```
#### Pattern 2: Root on the A String (12th Fret for A Minor, or Open for A Minor)

This pattern is also very common and provides a different feel across the neck. I'll show the open A minor variation as it's frequently used. To make it movable, think of the open A as the root of the scale.

**A Natural Minor (Open Position)**

```
   o   2   3  <-- Fingers
D|-----------------------0--1---|
A|--------------------1--3------|
F|-----------------0--2---------|
C|--------------0--2--3---------|
G|--0--2--3---------------------|
C|------------------------------|
   (Root)
```


## Black metal scales

Great question! 🤘 Black metal is known for its raw, atmospheric, and often chaotic sound — and the scales used play a huge role in creating that dark, eerie vibe. While black metal is highly expressive and experimental, there are several **scales** that are commonly used across the genre.

---

## 🎯 Core Scales Used in Black Metal

### 1. **Natural Minor (Aeolian Mode)**
- **Why it's used**: Dark, melancholic, and classic-sounding.
- **Formula**: `1 - 2 - ♭3 - 4 - 5 - ♭6 - ♭7`
- **Example**: A Minor → A B C D E F G

🔥 Common in traditional black metal (think Mayhem, Burzum, early Darkthrone).

---

### 2. **Harmonic Minor**
- **Why it's used**: Adds tension, exoticism, and that signature "evil" sound.
- **Formula**: `1 - 2 - ♭3 - 4 - 5 - ♭6 - ♯7`
- **Example**: A Harmonic Minor → A B C D E F G♯

💀 Gives black metal its signature “devil’s interval” sound (the augmented 2nd between ♭6 and ♯7).

🔥 Used by bands like Emperor, Dimmu Borgir, and Gorgoroth.

---

### 3. **Phrygian Dominant** *(also called Dominant Phrygian)*
- **Why it's used**: Dark, Middle Eastern, occult vibe.
- **Formula**: `1 - ♭2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - ♭6 - ♭7`
- **Example**: A Phrygian Dominant → A B♭ C# D E F G

🌑 Very popular in atmospheric and symphonic black metal (e.g., Carach Angren, Summoning).

🔁 Related to the **Phrygian mode**, but with a major 3rd.

---

### 4. **Locrian**
- **Why it's used**: Extremely dissonant and unstable — perfect for chaos.
- **Formula**: `1 - ♭2 - ♭3 - 4 - ♭5 - ♭6 - ♭7`
- **Example**: A Locrian → A B♭ C D E♭ F G

☠️ Not super common in riffs but shows up in ambient/noise sections and avant-garde black metal (e.g., Blut Aus Nord, Deathspell Omega).

---

### 5. **Pentatonic Minor**
- **Why it's used**: Simplicity + attitude. Great for fast tremolo picking and riffing.
- **Formula**: `1 - ♭3 - 4 - 5 - ♭7`
- **Example**: A Minor Pentatonic → A C D E G

⚡ Used in almost all black metal styles for raw, aggressive riffing.

---

### 6. **Melodic Minor (Ascending)**
- **Why it's used**: Melodic phrasing in solos; adds emotion and drama.
- **Formula (ascending)**: `1 - 2 - ♭3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7`
- **Descending**: Often played natural minor.

🎻 More common in melodic black metal and technical/progressive bands (e.g., Disillusion, Old Man’s Child).

---

## 🌲 Bonus: Modal & Exotic Scales

Some black metal bands explore even deeper into modal or non-Western scales:

- **Dorian Mode** (`1 - 2 - ♭3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - ♭7`) – used for a darker jazz/blues feel in some atmospheric BM
- **Hungarian Minor** (`1 - 2 - ♭3 - #4 - 5 - ♭6 - 7`) – gives an Eastern European flavor
- **Neapolitan Scale** (`1 - ♭2 - ♭3 - 4 - 5 - ♭6 - ♭7`) – very dark and classical-sounding

🎼 Bands like **Ulver**, **Wardruna**, and **Agalloch** incorporate modal scales for folk/atmospheric textures.
