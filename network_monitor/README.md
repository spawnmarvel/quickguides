## How to check if network is exhausted?


Let me help you check for network exhaustion. Here are the key steps and indicators to monitor:

1. Check network utilization:
- Monitor bandwidth usage
- Look for consistently high network usage (>70-80%)
- Use tools like `netstat`, `iftop`, or `nload` on Linux

2. Monitor latency and packet loss:
- Use `ping` to test response times
- Run `traceroute` to identify bottlenecks
- Check for increased packet loss using tools like `mtr`

3. Look for these symptoms:
- Slow network response times
- Connection timeouts
- Dropped packets
- Applications failing to connect

4. Common monitoring commands:
```bash
# Check network interfaces
ifconfig or ip addr

# Monitor network traffic
iftop
netstat -i

# Check connections
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
```

5. Professional monitoring tools:
- Nagios
- PRTG
- SolarWinds
- Wireshark for detailed analysis

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these methods or provide specific commands for your operating system?


## How to check if network is exhausted? powershell and bash

Here are commands to check network exhaustion in both PowerShell and Bash:

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Check network adapter statistics
Get-NetAdapter | Select Name, Status, LinkSpeed
Get-NetAdapterStatistics

# Monitor network connections
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object State -eq 'Established'

# Check network utilization (continuous monitoring)
Get-Counter '\Network Interface(*)\Bytes Total/sec' -Continuous

# View current bandwidth usage
Get-NetAdapterStatistics | Select Name,ReceivedBytes,SentBytes
```

**Bash:**
```bash
# Check network interfaces and traffic
ifconfig
# or
ip addr

# Monitor network traffic in real-time
iftop
# or
nethogs

# Check network connections
netstat -tuln
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED

# Monitor bandwidth usage
nload
# or
bmon

# Check for errors and dropped packets
ifconfig | grep -i "dropped|errors"
# or
ip -s link
```

Additional useful Bash commands for detailed analysis:
```bash
# System network statistics
vmstat 1
iostat 1

# Network throughput
iperf3 -s   # server
iperf3 -c server_ip   # client
```

These tools will help you identify:
- High bandwidth usage
- Network congestion
- Connection problems
- Packet loss
- Interface errors


## So when we run the commands, what are we looking for?

Here are the key indicators of network exhaustion to look for when running these commands:

**High Utilization Signs:**
1. Bandwidth Usage:
- Over 70-80% of network capacity being used
- Sustained high traffic rates
- Sudden spikes in traffic

2. Connection Status:
- Large number of ESTABLISHED/WAIT states
- Many TIME_WAIT connections
- Connection failures or timeouts

**Specific Metrics to Watch:**

In PowerShell output:
```powershell
Get-NetAdapterStatistics:
- High PacketsReceiveDiscarded
- Increasing PacketsReceivedErrors
- Large number of OutputQueueLength
```

In Bash output:
```bash
netstat/ip output:
- High RX/TX dropped packets
- Increasing error counts
- Buffer overruns
- Interface errors > 0
```

**Warning Signs:**
1. Latency:
- ping responses > 100ms (local network)
- Increasing response times
- Packet loss > 1%

2. Interface Statistics:
- Collisions > 0
- Overruns > 0
- Buffer errors increasing
- Queue drops rising

3. Memory/CPU Impact:
- Network service high CPU usage
- Network buffer memory exhaustion
- System slowdowns during network activity

If you see several of these indicators together, your network is likely experiencing exhaustion or congestion issues.


## Scripts


Here's a PowerShell script that monitors these network metrics and alerts you when they exceed certain thresholds:

To use this script:

Save it as Monitor-Network.ps1
Run it with default parameters:

.\Monitor-Network.ps1
Or customize the thresholds:

.\Monitor-Network.ps1 -checkInterval 10 -discardThreshold 50 -errorThreshold 25 -queueThreshold 10

***monitor_network.ps1***

The script:

Monitors all active network adapters
Updates every 5 seconds (default)
Shows current statistics
Alerts (in red) when thresholds are exceeded
Tracks changes between intervals
Shows adapter name, status, and link speed
Continues running until you press Ctrl+C

Here's a Bash script that monitors network interface statistics and alerts for these conditions:

To use this script:

Save it as network_monitor.sh
Make it executable:

chmod +x network_monitor.sh
Run with default parameters:

sudo ./network_monitor.sh
Or with custom parameters:

sudo ./network_monitor.sh -i 10 -d 50 -e 25

***monitor_network.sh***

The script:

Requires root privileges
Monitors all network interfaces (except loopback)
Updates every 5 seconds by default
Shows RX/TX statistics including:
Bytes transferred
Dropped packets
Errors
Overruns
Alerts (in red) when thresholds are exceeded
Tracks changes between intervals
Continues running until you press Ctrl+C
Parameters:

-i: Check interval in seconds
-d: Dropped packets threshold
-e: Error threshold
-h: Show help message
