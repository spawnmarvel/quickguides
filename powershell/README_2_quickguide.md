## Function logger

```ps1

# Function to append to the log file
function Write-Log {
    param(
        [string]$Message
    )
    try {
    
        $logFile = "c:\temp\ps1_log.txt"  #  <-- Add the log file path
        $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
        $logEntry = "$timestamp - $Message"
        $logEntry | Out-File -FilePath $logFile -Append
        # For console also, ca be commented out
        Write-Host $logEntry
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "ERROR: Failed to write to log file: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
    }

}

# Example
# Define the target directory and log file path
$targetDirectory = "C:\Program Files\myapp\logs"
Write-Log "Directory '$targetDirectory' done."

```
## Manage variables in Windows PowerShell scripts

```ps1

# To review the variables contained in memory by reviewing the contents of the PowerShell drive named Variable, use the following command:

$MyCounter = 10
Get-ChildItem variable:

# You can also review the variables in memory by using the Get-Variable cmdlet:
Get-Variable

# Variable names aren't case sensitive. The variables $USER and $user are interchangeable. 

# All variables are assigned a type. The variable type determines the data that can be stored in it. In most cases, Windows PowerShell automatically determines the type of a variable during assignment of its value. 
# Automatic assignment of the variable type works well most of the time. 
[Int]$num2 = "5"
[DateTime]$date = "January 5, 2022 10:00AM"

# You can review a variableâ€™s type by appending the GetType() method to the name of the variable.
$MyCounter = 10
$MyCounter.GetType()


# Just as objects in Windows PowerShell have properties and methods, so do variables. 

$MyCounter = 10
$MyCounter.GetType()
$MyCounter | Get-Member


```

Use string variables and methods in Windows PowerShell scripts

```ps1

$MyString = "This is my string"
# The string variable has only one property, Length. 
Write-Host $MyString.Length

# But many methods
$MyString | Get-Member

# example replace method
$MyString.Replace("my string", "a method")

```

## What is the pipeline?

At its core, the pipeline is just the | (pipe) character. You simply put it in between PowerShell commands and it takes the output of one command and feeds it as the input to the next.

For each
```ps1
$dir = "C:\temp2" 
# get all files and folders
$files = $dir | Get-ChildItem

# Loop through each file
foreach ($file in $files) {
  # Check if the file is larger than 100MB
  if ($file.Length -lt 100MB) {
    # Display the file
    write-host $file
  }
}

```
A nested pip does the same

```ps1
$dir = "C:\temp2" 

$all = $dir | Get-ChildItem | Where-Object {$_.Length -lt 100MB}
write-host $all

```
Finding process using more than 300 MB of memory

```ps1
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.WorkingSet -gt 300mb}
```

Get the service status of services starting with R
```ps1
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "R*"}
```


## Everything you wanted to know about

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-arrays?view=powershell-7.5

### Use variables, arrays, arraylist and hash tables

```ps1
# You also can create an array by using the output from a command
$files = Get-ChildItem C:\temp\

# To identify what you can do with the content in an array, use the Get-Member cmdlet.
$files | Get-Member

# To review the properties and methods available for an array rather than the items within the array, use the following syntax:
Get-Member -InputObject $files

# To address the shortcomings of arrays, you can use an array list.
[System.Collections.ArrayList]$files = Get-ChildItem C:\temp\

$files | Get-Member
# FullName                  Property       string FullName {get;}
# [...]

# Iterate and use properties
foreach ($file in $files){ 
write-host $file.FullName
}


# To create an array list that's empty and ready to add items, use the following syntax:


$computers=New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList

$computers.Add("VM1")
$computers.Add("VM2")
Write-Host $computers

# If you want to remove an item from an array list based on the index number, you use the RemoveAt() method. For example:
$computers.RemoveAt(1)
Write-Host $computers

# By name
$computers.Remove("VM1")

# Call propertie count
Write-Host $computers.Count
Write-Host $computers

# Define hash tables in Windows PowerShell Scripts
# A hash table represents a similar concept to an array since it stores multiple items. However, unlike an array which uses an index number to identify each item, a hash table uses for this purpose a unique key. The key is a string that's a unique identifier for the item. Each key in a hash table is associated with a value.

$ComputersTable = @{}
# add
$ComputersTable["VM1"] = "10.0.0.11"
$ComputersTable["VM2"] = "10.0.0.12"
# access items
$ComputersTable["VM1"]

```

## Automate administrative tasks by using PowerShell MS Learn

### Discover commands in PowerShell

* Inspect commands to understand how to call them.
* Understand what a command returns and customize what it returns.

```ps1

Get-Help -Name Get-Help

Get-Help -Name Get-Service

Get-Help -Name Get-ChildItem

```

* NAME: Provides the name of the command.
* SYNTAX: Shows ways to call the command by using a combination of flags, and sometimes, allowed parameters.
* ALIASES: Lists any aliases for a command. An alias is a different name for a command, and it can be used to invoke the command.
* REMARKS: Provides information about what commands to run to get more help for this command.
* PARAMETERS: Provides details about the parameter. It lists its type, a longer description, and acceptable values, if applicable.

Filter the help response
If you don't want to display the full help page, narrow the response by adding flags to your Get-Help command. Here are some flags you can use:

* Full: Returns a detailed help page. It specifies information like parameters, inputs, and outputs that you don't get in the standard response.
* Detailed: Returns a response that looks like the standard response, but it includes a section for parameters.
* Examples: Returns only examples, if any exist.
Online: Opens a web page for your command.
* Parameter: Requires a parameter name as an argument. It lists a specific parameter's properties.


```ps1

Get-Help -Name Get-ChildItem -Examples

# Example pip the result for all examples to a file, is better to read that way.
Get-Help -Name Get-ChildItem -Examples | Out-File -FilePath .out.txt

# Example 1: Get child items from a file system directory
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Test

# Example 2: Get child items in the current directory and subdirectories
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Test\*.txt -Recurse -Force

# Example 3 When using the -Include parameter, if you don't include an asterisk in the path the command returns no output. Here it returns .txt files only
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Test\ -Include *.txt
```

Discover objects

```ps1
# Discover objects by using Get-Member
$v = Get-Process -Name 'Sql*'

# Get-members
$v = Get-Process -Name 'Sql*' | Get-Member

# List all members and types
$v

# Filter a Get-Member result by using Select-Object
$v = Get-Process -Name 'Sql*' | Get-Member | Select-Object Name, MemberType

# Get only methods
$v = Get-Process -Name 'Sql*' | Get-Member | Select-Object Name, MemberType | Where-Object MemberType -eq 'Method'

```

### Connect commands into a pipeline TBD

In PowerShell, you run compiled commands, or cmdlets. By connecting these cmdlets, you can create powerful combined statements, or pipelines. You'll find such combined statements useful as you're looking to automate your workflows.

```ps1

# Note how you're using the pipe | and that by calling Get-Member, you are in fact creating a pipeline already.
Get-Process | Get-Member


```

Select-Object

```ps1

# PowerShell automatically adds the command Out-Default.
# The view generally doesn't contain all the properties of an object because it wouldn't display properly on screen,
# You can override the default view by using Select-Object and choosing your own list of properties.
# You can then send those properties to Format-Table or Format-List, to display the table however you like.

# Consider the result of running Get-Process on the process vmms
Get-Process vmms

 NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
 ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
     27    42.05      33.45       0.00    3584   0 vmms

# Getting the full response
Get-Process vmms | Format-List -Property *

Name                       : vmms
Id                         : 3584
PriorityClass              :
FileVersion                :
HandleCount                : 585
WorkingSet                 : 35074048
[...]

# Finding the real property name
Get-Process vmms

 NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
 ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
     27    42.05      33.45       0.00    3584   0 vmms


# To find out the real name for a specific property, you can use Get-Member
Get-Process zsh | Get-Member -Name C*

# You now get a list of all members with names that start with a C. Among them is CPU

```

Select-Object

```ps1
Get-Process vmms | Select-Object -Property Id, Name, CPU

  Id Name CPU
  -- ---- ---
3584 vmms

```

Sort-Object

```ps1
# This example sorts by name, default ascending
Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property Name

# sort by many columns
Get-Process | Sort-Object -Descending -Property Name, CPU

# more powerfull expressions
Get-Process | Where-Object CPU -gt 2 | Sort-Object CPU | Select-Object -First 3

```
Use formatting and filtering

In a pipeline statement, filtering left means filtering for the results you want as early as possible. 

You can think of the term left as early, because PowerShell statements run from left to right.

```ps1

# This statement first retrieves all of the processes on the machine. It ends up formatting the response so that only the Name property is listed. 
# This statement doesn't follow the filtering left principle, because it operates on all the processes, attempts to format the response, and then filters at the end.
# Bad... use oppostite of sql
Get-Process | Select-Object Name | Where-Object Name -eq 'vmms'

# It's better to filter first and then format
Get-Process | Where-Object Name -eq 'vmms' | Select-Object Name

```
Formatting right, formatting as the last thing you do

Whereas filtering left means to filter something as early as possible in a statement, formatting right means to format something as late as possible in the statement.

* The formatting destroys the object with which you're dealing.

```ps1

# example
Get-Process 'some process' | Select-Object Name, CPU | Get-Member

# The type you get back is System.Diagnostics.Process.
# What these types are, isn't important for this lesson. 
# What's important to realize is that when you use any type of formatting command, your data is different.

# Let's illustrate with an example:
Get-Process | Where-Object Name -eq 'vmms' | Select-Object Name, id

Name   Id
----   --
vmms 3584

# Let's use formatting first and then Select-Object, to illustrate what might happen if you don't format last:
Get-Process | Where-Object Name -eq 'vmms' | Format-Table Name, Id | Select-Object Name, Id

Name Id
---- --

# It's empty, because Format-Table transformed the object containing your results by placing data into other properties. Your data isn't gone, only your properties. 


```
Formatting commands should be the last thing you use in your statement because they're meant for formatting things nicely for screen presentation. 

```ps1

"a string" | Get-Member
Name                 MemberType            Definition
 ----                 ----------            ----------
 Clone                Method                System.Object Clone(), System.Object ICloneable.Clone()
 CompareTo            Method                int CompareTo(System.Object value), int CompareTo(string strB), int IComparable.CompareTo(â€¦


"a string" | Get-Member | Format-List
TypeName   : System.String
 Name       : Clone
 MemberType : Method
 Definition : System.Object Clone(), System.Object ICloneable.Clone()

 TypeName   : System.String
 Name       : CompareTo
 MemberType : Method
 Definition : int CompareTo(System.Object value), int CompareTo(string strB), int IComparable.CompareTo(System.Object obj), int 
              IComparable[string].CompareTo(string other)
