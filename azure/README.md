## AZ-104: Prerequisites for Azure administrators


| Type | Description | How | Responsibility
| ---- | ------------| ------- | -------------
| IAAS | IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity. | Msts, RDP | You most 70%
| PASS | PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer. | Connection string | Middle you and cloud 50-50 %
| SAAS | On the other end of the spectrum, SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider. | Login | Cloud 70%
| Data | Information and data, Devices that are allowed to connect, Accounts and identities. | | You 100%
| Infrastructure | Physical datacenter, physical network, physical hosts. | | Cloud 100%
| CLI | The CLI is cross-platform and can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows. | |
| PS1 | On both Linux and macOS, you'll use a package manager to install PowerShell Core. On macOS, you'll use Homebrew to install PowerShell. | |
| ARM Template | JSON file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for the deployment. Templates declare what will be deployed without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it.  | |
| Idempotent | What happens if the same template is run a second time?  | | 
| 1. | If the resource already exists and no change is detected in the properties, no action is taken. | |
| 2. | If the resource already exists and a property has changed, the resource is updated. | | 
| 3. |If the resource doesn't exist, it's created. ||
| LRS | Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates your storage account three times within a single data center in the primary region | 11 nines | 
| ZRS |  Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your storage account synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. | 12 9â€™s |
| GRS | Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) is like the LRS option, but it adds a secondary region for durability. | |
| GZRS | Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS) protects your data by copying it to three availability zones in the primary region using ZRS. It then replicates data asynchronously to a single data center in the secondary region using LRS. | |

```
# The following example creates an AKS cluster with a single node pool backed by a virtual machine scale set. 
# It also enables the cluster autoscaler on the node pool for the cluster and sets a minimum of 1 and maximum of 3 nodes:

# First create a resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Now create the AKS cluster and enable the cluster autoscaler
az aks create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \
  --node-count 1 \
  --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \
  --load-balancer-sku standard \
  --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
  --min-count 1 \
  --max-count 3


# To enable and configure the cluster autoscaler on the node pool for the existing cluster
az aks update \ 
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \
  --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ # Use the --enable-cluster-autoscaler
  --min-count 1 \ # specify a node --min-count
  --max-count 3   # specify a node --max-count

# To change the node count, use the az aks update command.
az aks update \ 
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myAKSCluster \

* * Must be in same region as rg's

### Create an Azure Backup vault

*  What is difference between Recovery Services vault and backup vault
1. The first difference between an Azure Recovery Services Vault (ARSV) and an Azure Backup Vault (ABV) is are the available datasources of each vault.
2. The second difference is: In an ARSV you can be used for Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery data. An ABV is for Azure Backup data only.
