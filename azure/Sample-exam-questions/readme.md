| Item      | Description
| -------   | -------------------------------
| Answer    | A AND B
| Objective | 1.1 Manage Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) objects
| Rationale | Groups that use dynamic membership rules reduce the overhead of access management by providing attribute-based membership and access to resources. Based on membership rules the membership, and resulting access, can be granted and removed automatically.

| Item      | Description
| -------   | -------------------------------

### Question # 3 (Multiple Choice)

You have a production Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named contoso.com.

You deploy a development Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant, and then you create several custom administrative roles in the development tenant.

You need to copy the roles to the production tenant.

What should you do first?

A. From the development tenant, export the custom roles to JSON.
B. From the production tenant, create a new custom role.
C. From the development tenant, perform a backup.
D. From the production tenant, create an administrative unit.


| Item      | Description
| -------   | -------------------------------
| Answer    | A
| Objective | 1.2 Manage access control
| Rationale | Creating Custom roles in Azure can be complex due to thousands of permissions so custom roles can be exported as JSON and then imported into a new custom role. The first step is to export the role to a JSON format. A JSON file can then be imported into another tenant; containing all of the details in the custom role.
