Things to know about user accounts

* Cloud identity
* * A user account with a cloud identity is defined only in Azure AD. 

* Directory-synchronized identity
* * User accounts that have a directory-synchronized identity are defined in an on-premises Active Directory. A synchronization activity occurs via Azure AD Connect to bring these user accounts in to Azure. The source for these accounts is Windows Server Active Directory.

* Guest user
* * Guest user accounts are defined outside Azure.

#### Manage user accounts



#### Create bulk user accounts

Bulk operations, including bulk create and delete for user accounts.
