Loose coupling:

Loose coupling: Among different classes/modules should be minimal dependency.

Low coupling suggest that class should have least possible dependencies. 
Also, dependencies that must exist should be weak dependencies - prefer dependency on interface rather than dependency on concrete class, 
prefer composition over inheritance 

Coupling refers to the degree to which the different modules/classes depend on each other, 
it is suggested that all modules should be independent as far as possible, that's why low coupling. 
It has to do with the elements among different modules/classes.

High cohesion:

High cohesion: Elements within one class/module should functionally belong together and do one particular thing.

In software design high cohesion means that class should do one thing and one thing very well.

Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements of a module/class belong together, 
it is suggested that the related code should be close to each other, 
so we should strive for high cohesion and bind all related code together as close as possible. 
It has to do with the elements within the module/class.
