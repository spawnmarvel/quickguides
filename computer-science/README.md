## Bits and bytes

In the context of computing and digital information, a **bit** (short for **bi**nary digi**t**) is the most fundamental and smallest unit of data.

Here's a breakdown of what a bit is:

1.  **Binary Nature:**
    * It can exist in only one of two possible states. These states are usually represented as:
        * **0** (zero) or **1** (one)
        * On or Off
        * True or False
        * High or Low voltage
        * Magnetized in one direction or the other

2.  **The Smallest Unit of Information:** Because it can only represent two states, a single bit can answer a simple "yes/no" or "on/off" question.

3.  **Building Block:** While a single bit carries very little information, bits are combined to form larger units of data, which can then represent more complex information:
    * **Byte:** The most common next unit. A byte consists of **8 bits**. A byte can represent $2^8 = 256$ different values (e.g., a single character like 'A', 'b', '$', or a small number).
    * **Kilobit (Kb):** 1,000 bits (used often for network speeds, e.g., Mbps - Megabits per second).
    * **Kilobyte (KB):** 1,024 bytes (used often for file sizes, e.g., MB - Megabytes).
    * And so on, to Megabits/Megabytes, Gigabits/Gigabytes, etc.

4.  **Why Binary?**
    * Computers use bits because it's easy to represent these two states electronically (e.g., presence or absence of an electrical signal, direction of magnetism). This makes them highly reliable for storing and transmitting information, as there's minimal ambiguity.
    * The entire digital world, from your smartphone photos to complex AI models, is ultimately built upon combinations of these simple 0s and 1s.

**In simple terms, a bit is like a light switch: it's either on or off, and that simple choice is the bedrock of all digital information.**

### Statusword

A status word is a specific type of digital data, typically a fixed-size sequence of bits (like 8, 16, or 32 bits), where each individual bit or a predefined group of bits represents a particular condition, state, or flag within a system or device.


A 16-bit status word is a common way for industrial devices, microcontrollers, and communication protocols to convey their current state. It's a sequence of 16 binary digits (bits), where each bit (or a small group of bits) represents a specific "on" or "off" condition, a state, or an error.

Here's an example of a **16-bit status word for an industrial motor drive**, common in automation systems using protocols like PROFIdrive or CANopen:

**Conceptual Layout of the 16-bit Status Word:**

```
Bit Position: 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
              -------------------------------------------------
Bit Name/Flag: | Rsv | Rsv |  Man. |  Velo  |  Switch  | Drive |
               |     |     |  Spec |  Limit |  On     | State |
               |     |     | Flags | Flags  | Flags   | Flags |
```

And here's a common assignment of meanings to some of these bits:

| Bit No. | Bit Name (Common)           | Meaning if `1` (Active/True)                                   | Meaning if `0` (Inactive/False)                                   | Category       |
| :------ | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |

| **06** | **Switch On Inhibit** | Generic inhibit to prevent switching on.                         | Switch on is not inhibited.                                       | Drive State    |
| **07** | **Warning Active** | A non-critical warning is present (e.g., over-temperature warning, low voltage warning). | No active warnings.                                               | Warning Flag   |

**How to Interpret a Status Word (Example):**

Let's say a PLC reads the following 16-bit binary value from the motor drive's status word register:

`0000 0000 0010 0111` (binary)

Breaking it down by bit:

* **Bit 0 (1):** Ready to Switch On - **TRUE**
* **Bit 1 (1):** Switched On - **TRUE**
* **Bit 2 (1):** Operation Enabled - **TRUE**
* **Bit 3 (0):** Fault Active - **FALSE**
* **Bit 4 (0):** Switch On Disabled - **FALSE**
* **Bit 5 (1):** Quick Stop Active - **TRUE**
* **Bit 6 (0):** Switch On Inhibit - **FALSE**
* **Bit 7 (0):** Warning Active - **FALSE**
* **Bit 8 (0):** Speed/Position Deviation - **FALSE**
* **Bit 9 (1):** At Target Velocity - **TRUE**
* ...and so on for the higher bits which are `0` in this example.

**Interpretation:**

This status word tells the PLC:
"The drive is currently **running** (Bits 0, 1, 2 are all true, implying an operational state), it has reached its **target velocity** (Bit 9 is true), but critically, the **Quick Stop function is currently active** (Bit 5 is true). There are no general faults or warnings."

This kind of combination could indicate a specific sequence of operations or an unexpected state where the drive is running but also preparing for or performing a quick stop. The PLC's logic would then interpret this pattern and react accordingly.

### Derivation of on and off

You've provided the exact breakdown, which is the perfect way to "check" what bit is on or off!

To understand **how** that breakdown is derived, or to perform it for any other binary sequence, you need to understand two key principles:

1.  **Bit Indexing (Position):** Bits are typically indexed starting from **0** (zero) on the **rightmost** side. This is called the Least Significant Bit (LSB). As you move left, the index increases. So, a 16-bit word has bits from position 0 to 15.

    ```
    Bit Position: 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
    Binary Value: 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  1  1  1
    ```

2.  **Checking the Value of Each Bit:** Once you know the position, you simply look at the digit at that position.

    * If the digit is `1`, the bit is **ON** (or "set," "true," "active").
    * If the digit is `0`, the bit is **OFF** (or "clear," "false," "inactive").

### Let's re-apply it to your example: `0000 0000 0010 0111`

We read from right to left, starting at bit 0:

* **Bit 0:** The digit is `1`. So, Bit 0 is **ON**. (Ready to Switch On)
* **Bit 1:** The digit is `1`. So, Bit 1 is **ON**. (Switched On)
* **Bit 2:** The digit is `1`. So, Bit 2 is **ON**. (Operation Enabled)
* **Bit 3:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 3 is **OFF**. (Fault Active)
* **Bit 4:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 4 is **OFF**. (Switch On Disabled)
* **Bit 5:** The digit is `1`. So, Bit 5 is **ON**. (Quick Stop Active)
* **Bit 6:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 6 is **OFF**. (Switch On Inhibit)
* **Bit 7:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 7 is **OFF**. (Warning Active)
* **Bit 8:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 8 is **OFF**. (Speed/Position Deviation)
* **Bit 9:** The digit is `1`. So, Bit 9 is **ON**. (At Target Velocity)
* **Bit 10:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 10 is **OFF**. (At Target Position)
* **Bit 11:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 11 is **OFF**. (Internal Limit Active)
* **Bit 12:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 12 is **OFF**. (Homing Attained)
* **Bit 13:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 13 is **OFF**. (External Inhibit Active)
* **Bit 14:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 14 is **OFF**. (Manufacturer Specific Flag 1)
* **Bit 15:** The digit is `0`. So, Bit 15 is **OFF**. (Manufacturer Specific Flag 2)

### In Programming (Bitwise Operations)

When you're dealing with status words in programming (e.g., C, Python, Java, PLC languages), you don't typically convert the whole binary string to a decimal and then back to bits. Instead, you use **bitwise operations**.

The most common way to check if a specific bit is ON is using the **bitwise AND (`&`)** operator with a **mask**.

**Formula:** `(status_word_value & (1 << bit_position)) != 0`

* `status_word_value`: The decimal (or hexadecimal) representation of your binary status word.
* `1 << bit_position`: This creates a "mask" where only the bit at `bit_position` is `1`, and all other bits are `0`. (e.g., `1 << 0` is `000...0001`, `1 << 1` is `000...0010`, `1 << 5` is `000...100000`).
* `&`: The bitwise AND operator. It compares corresponding bits; if both are `1`, the result bit is `1`, otherwise `0`.
* `!= 0`: If the result of the AND operation is anything other than zero, it means that the bit at `bit_position` in the `status_word_value` was also `1`.

**Example in Python (for `0000 0000 0010 0111`):**

First, convert your binary string to its decimal equivalent:
`0000 0000 0010 0111` (binary) = `(1 * 2^5) + (1 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0)`
`= 32 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 39` (decimal)

```python
status_word_dec = 39 # Decimal representation of 0000 0000 0010 0111

# Check Bit 0 (Ready to Switch On)
bit_0_mask = 1 << 0  # Binary: ...00001
is_bit_0_on = (status_word_dec & bit_0_mask) != 0
print(f"Bit 0 (Ready to Switch On): {is_bit_0_on}") # Output: True

# Check Bit 3 (Fault Active)
bit_3_mask = 1 << 3  # Binary: ...01000
is_bit_3_on = (status_word_dec & bit_3_mask) != 0
print(f"Bit 3 (Fault Active): {is_bit_3_on}") # Output: False

# Check Bit 5 (Quick Stop Active)
bit_5_mask = 1 << 5  # Binary: ...100000
is_bit_5_on = (status_word_dec & bit_5_mask) != 0
print(f"Bit 5 (Quick Stop Active): {is_bit_5_on}") # Output: True

# Check Bit 9 (At Target Velocity)
bit_9_mask = 1 << 9  # Binary: ...1000000000
is_bit_9_on = (status_word_dec & bit_9_mask) != 0
print(f"Bit 9 (At Target Velocity): {is_bit_9_on}") # Output: True
```

This method is efficient and commonly used in low-level programming and industrial control applications to interpret status words.
