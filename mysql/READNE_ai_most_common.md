# Can you make me a tutorial in mysql with lab task for the most common scenarios on with mysql?

## Here's a comprehensive MySQL tutorial with lab tasks covering the most common scenarios.

**Tutorial Overview**

This tutorial covers the basics of MySQL, including creating databases, tables, and indexes, as well as querying and manipulating data. It also covers more advanced topics such as joins, subqueries, and transactions.

**Lab Environment**

To complete the lab tasks, you will need access to a MySQL server. You can use a local installation of MySQL or a cloud-based service such as AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL.

**Lab Task 1: Creating a Database and Table**

In this task, you will create a database and table to store information about books.

**Step 1: Create a database**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bookstore;
```

**Step 2: Create a table**

```sql
USE bookstore;

CREATE TABLE books (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  publication_date DATE NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```

**Lab Task 2: Inserting Data**

In this task, you will insert data into the `books` table.

**Step 1: Insert a single row**

```sql
INSERT INTO books (title, author, publication_date, price)
VALUES ('To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee', '1960-07-11', 15.99);
```

**Step 2: Insert multiple rows**

```sql
INSERT INTO books (title, author, publication_date, price)
VALUES
  ('1984', 'George Orwell', '1949-06-08', 12.99),
  ('Pride and Prejudice', 'Jane Austen', '1813-01-28', 11.99),
  ('The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', '1925-04-10', 14.99);
```

**Lab Task 3: Querying Data**

In this task, you will query the `books` table to retrieve specific data.

**Step 1: Retrieve all rows**

```sql
SELECT * FROM books;
```

**Step 2: Retrieve specific columns**

```sql
SELECT title, author FROM books;
```

**Step 3: Retrieve rows with a specific condition**

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE price > 15.00;
```

**Lab Task 4: Updating Data**

In this task, you will update data in the `books` table.

**Step 1: Update a single row**

```sql
UPDATE books
SET price = 16.99
WHERE id = 1;
```

**Step 2: Update multiple rows**

```sql
UPDATE books
SET price = price * 1.10
WHERE publication_date < '1950-01-01';
```

**Lab Task 5: Deleting Data**

In this task, you will delete data from the `books` table.

**Step 1: Delete a single row**

```sql
DELETE FROM books
WHERE id = 2;
```

**Step 2: Delete multiple rows**

```sql
DELETE FROM books
WHERE publication_date < '1900-01-01';
```

**Lab Task 6: Creating Indexes**

In this task, you will create indexes on the `books` table to improve query performance.

**Step 1: Create a single-column index**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_title ON books (title);
```

**Step 2: Create a multi-column index**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_author_publication_date ON books (author, publication_date);
```

**Lab Task 7: Joining Tables**

In this task, you will create a new table called `authors` and join it with the `books` table.

**Step 1: Create the `authors` table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE authors (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  birthdate DATE NOT NULL
);
```

**Step 2: Insert data into the `authors` table**

```sql
INSERT INTO authors (name, birthdate)
VALUES
  ('Harper Lee', '1926-04-28'),
  ('George Orwell', '1903-06-25'),
  ('Jane Austen', '1775-12-16'),
  ('F. Scott Fitzgerald', '1896-09-24');
```

**Step 3: Join the `books` and `authors` tables**

```sql
SELECT books.title, authors.name
FROM books
JOIN authors ON books.author = authors.name;
```

**Lab Task 8: Using Subqueries**

In this task, you will use subqueries to retrieve data from the `books` table.

**Step 1: Use a subquery to retrieve rows with a specific condition**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM books
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM books);
```

**Step 2: Use a subquery to retrieve rows with a specific condition**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM books
WHERE author IN (SELECT name FROM authors WHERE birthdate < '1900-01-01');
```

**Lab Task 9: Using Transactions**

In this task, you will use transactions to ensure data consistency.

**Step 1: Start a transaction**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
```

**Step 2: Insert data into the `books` table**

```sql
INSERT INTO books (title, author, publication_date, price)
VALUES ('The Catcher in the Rye', 'J.D. Salinger', '1951-07-16', 13.99);
```

**Step 3: Roll back the transaction**

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

# Can you make me a tutorial in mysql with lab task for the most common scenarios with Data Normalization and Transactions (ACID Properties) ?

## Absolutely! Let's craft a tutorial on MySQL focused on Data Normalization and Transactions (ACID Properties), complete with lab tasks to solidify your understanding.

## MySQL Tutorial: Data Normalization and Transactions (ACID Properties)

This tutorial is divided into two main sections: **Data Normalization** and **Transactions (ACID Properties)**. Each section will include explanations, examples, and lab tasks for you to practice.

### Part 1: Data Normalization

**Introduction:**

Data Normalization is a database design technique used to organize tables in a manner that reduces redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to isolate data so that any modification to a single piece of data only requires changing it in one place. Normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and beyond) are a series of guidelines to help achieve this.

**Common Normal Forms:**

* **1NF (First Normal Form):**
    * Eliminate repeating groups within tables.
    * Create separate tables for each group of related data.
    * Identify each set of related data with a primary key.
* **2NF (Second Normal Form):**
    * Be in 1NF.
    * Remove partial dependencies of non-key attributes on the primary key (applies to composite keys).
* **3NF (Third Normal Form):**
    * Be in 2NF.
    * Remove transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depending on other non-key attributes).

**Example Scenario (Before Normalization):**

Imagine a table called `Orders` with the following structure:

| OrderID | CustomerName | CustomerAddress | ProductID | ProductName | Price | Quantity |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------|
| 1       | John Doe     | 123 Main St     | P1        | Laptop      | 1000  | 1        |
| 1       | John Doe     | 123 Main St     | P2        | Mouse       | 20    | 2        |
| 2       | Jane Smith   | 456 Oak Ave     | P1        | Laptop      | 1000  | 1        |

This table suffers from redundancy (Customer info repeated) and potential update anomalies.

**Normalization Steps:**

1. **1NF:** Create separate tables for Orders, Customers, and Products:

    * **Customers:** (CustomerID, CustomerName, CustomerAddress)
    * **Products:** (ProductID, ProductName, Price)
    * **Orders:** (OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity)

2. **2NF:**  If there were partial dependencies (assuming OrderID, ProductID together form the primary key of Orders table), we'd address them. However, in this simplified example, 2NF is already met.

3. **3NF:**  Ensure no transitive dependencies. Assuming we don't have non-key attributes depending on other non-key attributes, we're in 3NF.

**Lab Tasks - Data Normalization:**

**Task 1:**  Given the following unnormalized table for a library:

| BookID | Title | Author | AuthorNationality | BorrowerID | BorrowerName | BorrowerAddress | BorrowDate | ReturnDate |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| 1      | Book1 | John A | USA               | B1         | Alex B       | 789 Pine St     | 2023-01-10 | 2023-01-20 |
| 2      | Book2 | John A | USA               | B2         | Carol C      | 101 Elm St      | 2023-02-15 | 2023-02-25 |

Normalize this table to 3NF. Write the SQL statements to create the tables with appropriate primary and foreign keys.

**Task 2:** Design a database schema for a simple school system, starting with unnormalized data like this:

| StudentID | StudentName | CourseID | CourseName | TeacherID | TeacherName | Grade |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| S1        | Amy K       | C1       | Math       | T1        | Bob L       | A     |
| S1        | Amy K       | C2       | Science    | T2        | Mary M      | B     |

Normalize this to 3NF and provide the SQL statements for table creation.

### Part 2: Transactions (ACID Properties)

**Introduction:**

Transactions are a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. ACID properties ensure the reliability and integrity of database transactions.

**ACID Properties:**

* **Atomicity:**  All operations in a transaction are treated as a single unit. Either all are executed, or none are. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
* **Consistency:**  A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state, preserving database integrity.
* **Isolation:**  Transactions are executed independently of each other. Concurrent transactions do not affect each other's outcome.
* **Durability:**  Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in case of system failures.

**MySQL Transaction Commands:**

* **START TRANSACTION:** Begins a new transaction.
* **COMMIT:** Saves the changes made within a transaction permanently.
* **ROLLBACK:** Reverses the changes made within a transaction if an error occurs or if `ROLLBACK` is explicitly called.

**Example Scenario:**

Suppose we need to transfer money between two bank accounts.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1; -- Deduct 100 from Account 1
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2; -- Add 100 to Account 2

COMMIT; -- Save the changes if both updates were successful
```

If any error occurs during the updates, we can rollback:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;

-- Assume some error occurs here

ROLLBACK; -- Reverse the deduction from Account 1
```

**Lab Tasks - Transactions (ACID Properties):**

**Task 3:** Create a table `Products` with columns `ProductID`, `ProductName`, and `Stock`. Insert some sample data. Write a transaction to decrease the stock of a product by a certain quantity. If the resulting stock becomes negative, rollback the transaction; otherwise, commit.

**Task 4:** Create a table `Employees` with columns `EmployeeID`, `EmployeeName`, and `Salary`. Write a transaction to increase the salary of all employees by 10%. Demonstrate rollback by reverting the changes after performing the update.
