# 19 API

The Zabbix API allows you to programmatically retrieve and modify configuration of Zabbix and provides access to historical data. It is widely used to:

* Create new applications to work with Zabbix;
* Integrate Zabbix into a third-party software;
* Automate routine tasks.

The Zabbix API is an HTTP-based API, and it is shipped as a part of the web frontend. It uses the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol, which means two things:

* The API consists of a set of separate methods.
* Requests and responses between the clients and the API are encoded using the JSON format.
