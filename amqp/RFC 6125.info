Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service
 Identity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX)
     Certificates in the Context of Transport Layer Security (TLS)

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125



Likewise, during TLS
   negotiation, the server presents its notion of the service's identity
   in the form of a public-key certificate that was issued by a
   certification authority (CA) in the context of the Internet Public
   Key Infrastructure using X.509 [PKIX].  


Informally, we can think of
   these identities as the client's "reference identity" and the
   server's "presented identity"
