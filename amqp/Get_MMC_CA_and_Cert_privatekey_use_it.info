For importing the Intermediate Certificate, right click on the ‘Intermediate Certification Authorities’ and then go to All Tasks > Import

To import Root Certificates through MMC (Windows Microsoft Management Console), you must go through same process.

Choose

Run the following command to extract the private key:

openssl pkcs12 -in myfile.pfx -nocerts -out private.key.pem -nodes

You will be prompted again to provide a new password to protect the .key file that you are creating. 
Store the password to your key file in a secure place to avoid misuse.

Run the following command to extract the certificate:
clcerts
