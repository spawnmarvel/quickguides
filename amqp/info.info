Install rabbitmq run as admin

If RabbitMQ is installed using a non-administrative account, 
a shared secret file used by nodes and CLI tools will not be placed into a correct location, 
leading to authentication failures when rabbitmqctl.bat and other CLI tools are used.

If the Windows service is used, 
the cookie should be copied from C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\.erlang.cookie 
to the expected location for users running commands like rabbitmqctl.bat.

It is advisable to pre-configure a new user with a generated username and password 
or delete the guest user 
or at least change its password to reasonably secure generated value that won't be known to the public.

## SSL VM2

https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html

listeners.ssl	                    A list of ports to listen on for TLS connections. RabbitMQ can listen on a single interface or multiple ones.
ssl_options.cacertfile	            Certificate Authority (CA) bundle file path
ssl_options.certfile	            Server certificate file path
ssl_options.keyfile	                Server private key file path
ssl_options.verify	                Should peer verification be enabled?
ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert	When set to true, TLS connection will be rejected if client fails to provide a certificate


SSL and Client Certificate Authentication in RabbitMQ with .NET Standard 2.1
https://cjshelton.github.io/blog/2019/12/18/rabbitmq-client-certificate-authentication.html

Getting RabbitMQ to work over SSL can be tricky, and it is not helped by a confusion of terminology. SSL, 
Peer Verification and Certificate Authentication are very similar, but play a different role in the configuration of SSL in RabbitMQ.

* SSL and TLS are both cryptographic protocols used to secure data transmitted between a client and server, with TLS being the newer protocol which superseded SSL a while ago

* Peer Verification builds on top of SSL, and is a way for RabbitMQ to verify that the clients which are attempting to connect can be trusted, that is 
  — they present a certificate which is signed by a CA which the server also trusts.
   This helps ensure that only trusted clients can connect to the broker and helps prevent against Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
   If the client is not able to supply a trusted certificate, then the server will reject the connection. 
   The exception to this is if the fail_if_no_peer_cert configuration option is set to verify_none, in which case, the server will allow the connection.
   Peer Verification is not required in order to use SSL, but it is highly recommended, at least in production environments.

* Client Certificate Authentication
  SSL can also be used as a mechanism for clients to authenticate with the broker instead of the default username and password mechanism. 
  In order for clients to authenticate with SSL, they must present a certificate to the server which is signed by a trusted CA, 
  and which contains the login username as the Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN). More details on how to configure this later.


* Enabling SSL
  Creating the Certificates
   https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html#manual-certificate-generation

   highlight a few things which didn’t seem obvious:
   * The step to generate a client certificate is only required if you want to use Peer Verification. It is also required if you plan on using certificates for client authentication.
   * The CA file, which is used to self-sign the certificates, needs to be in the .pem format for RabbitMQ.
   * The CN or SAN of the server certificate must be set to the name of the host machine on which the broker will be running. The documentation states to use $(hostname), 
    but this should only be used if the machine you are generating the certificate is the same machine on which the broker will be running on.
   * The CN of the client certificate can be set to any arbitrary value, unless you are using the certificate for client authentication (explained later).
   * The passwords used to protect the server and client private keys can, and should, be different.
   * Although it is common to do it this way, the server and client certificates do not have to be signed by the same CA. 
    They can be different, as long as they are both trusted by the server and the client.



At this point, you should have the following files available:

A CA file in the .pem format.
A certificate/key pair for the server in the .pem format, signed by the CA, whose CN or SAN value is set to the hostname of the machine RabbitMQ will be running on.
A certificate/key pair for each client, signed by the CA. The format depends on the client-specific implementation.

Install the appropriate Visual Studio C++ Runtime found in the "prerequisites" folder in the "openssl-1.1" or "openssl-3 folder"


mkdir testca
cd testca
mkdir certs private

echo 01 > serial
create a new file index.txt (empty, is the db file)

Now add the following OpenSSL configuration file, openssl.cnf, within the newly created testca directory:

Directory of c:\testca

02/07/2022  05:12 PM    <DIR>          server



Edit openssl.cnf with win path “\\” and set hostname, view the file openssl.cnf

set OPENSSL_CONF=C:\testca\openssl.cnf
echo %OPENSSL_CONF%


openssl req -x509 -config C:\testca\openssl.cnf -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -out C:\testca\ca_certificate.pem -outform PEM -subj /CN=MyTestCA/ -nodes
openssl x509 -in C:\testca\ca_certificate.pem -out C:\testca\ca_certificate.cer -outform DER

C:\testca now has extra:
ca_certificate.pem
ca_certificate.cer


C:\testca\privat:
ca_private_key.pem


The process for creating server and client certificates is very similar. First the server

mkdir c:\testca\server

openssl genrsa -out c:\testca\server\private_key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -key c:\testca\server\private_key.pem -out c:\testca\server\req.pem -outform PEM -subj /CN=pdp-shovel-2/O=server/ -nodes
# NOTE ABOUT CN:
# check CN openssl x509 -noout -subject -in c:\testca\server\server_certificate.pem
# = subject=CN = pdp-shovel-2, O = server
# Change CN, make new for just CN, it does matter even if you use ip, view section ## Test 5. But CN should be hostname or FQDN
openssl req -new -key c:\testca\server2\private_key.pem -out c:\testca\server2\req.pem -outform PEM -subj /CN=pdp-shovel-2 -nodes

* Both (or all CN) works when only the server has certificates, after you have verified the vm2 build with self signed toward VM1 with no SSL config.
* Then you can set up: ################### Shovel VM1 with self signed VM2 Server, VM1 Client (with ssl options) will enforce VM2 server CA certificate after test 5

* That means VM2 has SSL in advanced config and VM1 only has amqps shovel in advanced config, not SSL

https://www.rabbitmq.com/shovel.html

WAN-friendly
The Shovel plugin uses client connections under the hood. Acknowledgements and publisher confirms are used to ensure data safety in case of connection and node failures.

https://www.rabbitmq.com/connections.html

* Connections

Protocol Differences
Different messaging protocols use different ports. Ports also vary for plain TCP and TLS-enabled connections. 
The Networking guide covers all ports used by RabbitMQ depending on what protocols are enabled, whether TLS is used and so on.
5672, 5671: used by AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0 clients without and with TLS


AMQP 0-9-1
AMQP 0-9-1 provides a way for connections to multiplex over a single TCP connection. That means an application can open multiple "lightweight connections" 
called channels on a single connection. 
AMQP 0-9-1 clients open one or more channels after connecting and perform protocol operations (manage topology, publish, consume) on the channels.

Protocol Differences
AMQP 0-9-1
AMQP 0-9-1 has a model that includes connections and channels. Channels allow for connection multiplexing (having multiple logical connections on a "physical" or TCP one).

AMQP 0-9-1 supports different authentication mechanisms. 
While it's most common for applications to provide a pair of credentials, 
x509 certificates and PKI can be used instead.

Turns out, later versions of Erlang require SNI information on connections, which is fine - except if that certificate is a wildcard certificate. 
The folks who work on Erlang made a decision to not validate wildcard certificates unless you specifically allow it

(hm. we have rabbitmq-server-3.9.12.exe.)
On RabbitMQ 3.8.11 and earlier, you could just turn SNI off - toss 
{server_name_indication,disable} into the ssl_options block and move on.
I don’t love this, but it could be OK depending on your threat model and how your LDAP servers are load balanced1.

NOTE: 
1 So it verifies correct ca_certificate for the sertificate that the server uses (tested with bad_ca_certificate.pem)
2 and it demands that the server must have a certificate 
3 but it does not look for CN=HOSTNAME or IP (which we generated 2 times, one with hostname and 1 with ip and checked it in openssl)
4 we bypass SNI, server name indication
5 (and the client VM1 is not using a certificate)
So this is:

https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/

TLS, the server has a TLS certificate and a public/private key pair, while the client does not. The typical TLS process works like this:
1 lient connects to server
2 Server presents its TLS certificate
3 Client verifies the server's certificate
4 Client and server exchange information over encrypted TLS connection

In mTLS, however, both the client and server have a certificate, and both sides authenticate using their public/private key pair.

The hostname check causing this errer is independent of X509 certificate authentication. Using recent versions of Erlang, 
TLS will verify that the host to which you connect (in this case, your shovel connection) matches the CN= value in the certificate presented by the server.
You can resolve this issue by using a server certificate with a CN value or SAN value that matches that IP address, 
or switch to using DNS names and ensuring the host name in the certificate matches the server's host name and the name you use in the amqps:// URI. 
You can also disable that check completely, but that leaves you open to certain security risks. 
Note that none of this is specific to RabbitMQ or Erlang, but is how TLS works everywhere. Previous versions of Erlang did not perform this check by default.

When the option verify is set to verify_peer the check public_key:pkix_verify_hostname/2 will be performed in addition to the usual x509-path validation checks. 
If the check fails the error {bad_cert, hostname_check_failed} will be propagated to the path validation fun verify_fun, where

The CA bundle must be installed on the client machine as a trusted authority. 
This CA is now trusted on the client machine, which means both the server and client certificates are inherently trusted too.

################### Config:
https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html


RabbitMQ 3.7.0+
%APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\rabbitmq.conf
In RabbitMQ 3.7.0+, the main configuration file is rabbitmq.conf. 
An additional config file named advanced.config is also used for some advanced configuration settings; it uses the classic format


Modern RabbitMQ versions allow for both formats to be used at the same time in separate files: 
rabbitmq.conf uses the new style format and is recommended for most settings
advanced.config covers more advanced settings that the ini-style configuration cannot express. 

Configuration File          Format Used                             Purpose                   
* rabbitmq.conf             New style format (sysctl or ini-like)   Primary configuration file. Should be used for most settings
