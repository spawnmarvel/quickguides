WAN-friendly
The Shovel plugin uses client connections under the hood. Acknowledgements and publisher confirms are used to ensure data safety in case of connection and node failures.

* Connections

Protocol Differences
Different messaging protocols use different ports. Ports also vary for plain TCP and TLS-enabled connections. 
The Networking guide covers all ports used by RabbitMQ depending on what protocols are enabled, whether TLS is used and so on.
5672, 5671: used by AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0 clients without and with TLS


AMQP 0-9-1
AMQP 0-9-1 provides a way for connections to multiplex over a single TCP connection. That means an application can open multiple "lightweight connections" 
called channels on a single connection. 
AMQP 0-9-1 clients open one or more channels after connecting and perform protocol operations (manage topology, publish, consume) on the channels.

Protocol Differences
AMQP 0-9-1
AMQP 0-9-1 has a model that includes connections and channels. Channels allow for connection multiplexing (having multiple logical connections on a "physical" or TCP one).

AMQP 0-9-1 supports different authentication mechanisms. 
While it's most common for applications to provide a pair of credentials, 
x509 certificates and PKI can be used instead.

################### Config:
https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html


RabbitMQ 3.7.0+
%APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\rabbitmq.conf
In RabbitMQ 3.7.0+, the main configuration file is rabbitmq.conf. 
An additional config file named advanced.config is also used for some advanced configuration settings; it uses the classic format


Modern RabbitMQ versions allow for both formats to be used at the same time in separate files: 
rabbitmq.conf uses the new style format and is recommended for most settings
advanced.config covers more advanced settings that the ini-style configuration cannot express. 

Configuration File          Format Used                             Purpose                   
* rabbitmq.conf             New style format (sysctl or ini-like)   Primary configuration file. Should be used for most settings

# listeners.tcp.default = 5672
# listeners.tcp.other_port = 5673



* advanced.config           Classic (Erlang terms)                  A limited number of settings that cannot be expressed in the new style configuration format
