.pem – Privacy Enhanced Mail Certificate. A PEM file is Base64 encoded and may be an X.509 certificate file, a private key file, or any other key material. PEM encoded files are commonly used in Apache and Tomcat servers.

.crt – Shorthand way to say “cert”, the .crt file extension is a security extension that may be either Base64 encoded or binary. Most commonly, .crt is a Base64 encoded certificate.

.cer – Shorthand way to almost say “cert”, the .cer file extension is an Internet Security Certificate that may be either Base64 encoded or binary. Most commonly, .cer is a binary certificate.

.der – The .der file extension is for a certificate file in binary format.

.pfx – The .pfx file extension is a PKCS12 certificate bundle which may contain an end entity certificate, a certificate chain, and matching private key. .pfx can be interchanged with .p12 and may be protected by a password.

.p12 – Personal Information Exchange File that is encrypted with a password and is interchangeable with the .pfx file extension.

* To convert a pem encoded certificate to a .crt extension, simply rename the file. This assumes you want .crt to be Base64 encoded. 

* To convert a pem encoded certificate to a .cer extension, simply rename the file. This assumes you want .cer to remain Base64 encoded. 

A pem encoded certificate is already a “cert”, and the .cert file extension isn’t a “real” extension, so it is better to used an already defined file extension such as .cer, .pem, or .crt.

* 2 When CSR approved is back, import certificate in MMC at the personal certificate store, if the cert is not valid, import all CA's in the store also. (They are missing)

* * If the content is on binary format, .cer*, meaning the cert content does not start with ----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
* * Import the .cer* to a local MMC (add signers also for verification). Then export it in MMC to format Base64 encoded. (.cer can be Base64 encoded or binary )
* * Then you can cp the txt content to wherever
* 2.1 When all CA's are imported in MMC, the personal should be valid. (If you cannot find the cert in mmc personal, import it direct on personal tab
)
* 3 Export personal from MMC as pfx (yes, export private key, include all certs if possible), save the password for later use just for openssl.

* * View IBM.info 

* 4 Now get the private key and extract the certificate fro the pfx file

* It could be that you need to type c:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl "enter"
* OpenSSL>

* 4.1 Run cms as admin navigate to openssl bin and check version
```cmd
cd "c:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin"
openssl version
```
* It should be OpenSSL 1.1.1m 14 Dec 2021

* 4.2 Run the following command to extract the private key:
```cmd
openssl pkcs12 -in myfile.pfx -nocerts -out private.key.pem -nodes
# enter the password used from the mmc export or create a new one.
```
* 4.3 Run the following command to extract the certificate
```cmd
openssl pkcs12 -in myfile.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out public.crt.pem -nodes
# enter the same password (from 4.2)
```
* 4.4 Run the following command to verify CN (must be hostname(.domain.something))
```cmd
openssl x509 -noout -subject -in public.crt.pem
```

## Automate the above

```cmd
# make request
certreq –new request.inf certificate.req

# The –accept parameter links the previously generated private key with the issued certificate and removes the pending certificate request from the system where the certificate is requested (if there's a matching request).

# imported the personal, not showing and certificate enrollment request is still there?
# use this if the request was generated by another user, or old OS etc.
certreq -accept certnew.cer

```
