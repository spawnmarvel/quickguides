.pem – Privacy Enhanced Mail Certificate. A PEM file is Base64 encoded and may be an X.509 certificate file, a private key file, or any other key material. PEM encoded files are commonly used in Apache and Tomcat servers.

.crt – Shorthand way to say “cert”, the .crt file extension is a security extension that may be either Base64 encoded or binary. Most commonly, .crt is a Base64 encoded certificate.

.cer – Shorthand way to almost say “cert”, the .cer file extension is an Internet Security Certificate that may be either Base64 encoded or binary. Most commonly, .cer is a binary certificate.

.der – The .der file extension is for a certificate file in binary format.

.pfx – The .pfx file extension is a PKCS12 certificate bundle which may contain an end entity certificate, a certificate chain, and matching private key. .pfx can be interchanged with .p12 and may be protected by a password.

.p12 – Personal Information Exchange File that is encrypted with a password and is interchangeable with the .pfx file extension.

* To convert a pem encoded certificate to a .crt extension, simply rename the file. This assumes you want .crt to be Base64 encoded. 

* To convert a pem encoded certificate to a .cer extension, simply rename the file. This assumes you want .cer to remain Base64 encoded. 

A pem encoded certificate is already a “cert”, and the .cert file extension isn’t a “real” extension, so it is better to used an already defined file extension such as .cer, .pem, or .crt.

* 2 When CSR approved is back, import certificate in MMC at the personal certificate store, if the cert is not valid, import all CA's in the store also. (They are missing)

* * If the content is on binary format, .cer*, meaning the cert content does not start with ----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
* * Import the .cer* to a local MMC (add signers also for verification). Then export it in MMC to format Base64 encoded. (.cer can be Base64 encoded or binary )
* * Then you can cp the txt content to wherever
* 2.1 When all CA's are imported in MMC, the personal should be valid. (If you cannot find the cert in mmc personal, import it direct on personal tab
)
* 3 Export personal from MMC as pfx (yes, export private key, include all certs if possible), save the password for later use just for openssl.

* * View IBM.info 

* 4 Now get the private key and extract the certificate fro the pfx file

* It could be that you need to type c:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl "enter"
* OpenSSL>

* 4.1 Run cms as admin navigate to openssl bin and check version
```cmd
cd "c:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin"
openssl version
```
* It should be OpenSSL 1.1.1m 14 Dec 2021

* * Update 05.11.2024 not tested, https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-converter.html
* * Public key is embedded in the SSL certificate and Private key is stored on the server and kept secret.
* * Only possible on linux? Seems so

* 4.2 Run the following command to extract the private key:
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in myfile.pfx -nocerts -out private.key.pem -nodes
# enter the password used from the mmc export or create a new one.
```
* 4.3 Run the following command to extract the certificate
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in myfile.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out public.crt.pem -nodes
# enter the same password (from 4.2)
```
* 4.4 Run the following command to verify CN (must be hostname(.domain.something))
```bash
openssl x509 -noout -subject -in public.crt.pem
```

* 4.5 Run the following command to verify end date (notAfter=Jan 27 10:36:48 2026 GMT)
```bash
openssl x509 -noout -enddate -in public.crt.pem
```

* 4.6 Run the following command to verify serial (59000017Axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
```bash
openssl x509 -noout -serial -in public.crt.pem
```

## Automate the above

```cmd
# make request
certreq –new request.inf certificate.req

# The –accept parameter links the previously generated private key with the issued certificate and removes the pending certificate request from the system where the certificate is requested (if there's a matching request).

# imported the personal, not showing and certificate enrollment request is still there?
# use this if the request was generated by another user, or old OS etc.
certreq -accept certnew.cer

```

## You can generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) on a different host and then use the resulting certificate and private key on your app host for mTLS (mutual TLS)

Yes, you can generate the CSR (and private key) on a different host, then transfer both the private key and the signed certificate to your app host for use with mTLS. Just make sure to keep the private key secure during the process.

How it’s commonly done:


1. Generate CSR and Private Key on Host A (Offline/Secure Host):
   - You generate a private key and a CSR on a secure machine (Host A).
   - The private key stays on Host A, and the CSR is sent to a Certificate Authority (CA) for signing.

2. Get the Signed Certificate:
   - The CA signs the CSR and returns a certificate.

3. Move the Private Key and Certificate to the App Host (Host B):
   - You securely copy both the private key and the signed certificate to the application host (Host B) where mTLS will be used.
   - Make sure to protect the private key during transfer (e.g., use secure copy methods like `scp` or `rsync` over SSH, and set appropriate permissions after transfer).


However, if you generate the CSR and private key on a different host, the Windows Certificate Manager on the app host will have no record of the original enrollment request. Therefore:

- When you import the certificate and private key (as a PFX, for example) onto the app host, the "Certificate Enrollment Requests" entry will not match or be satisfied.
- The pending enrollment request will remain in the certificate store as "orphaned."
- This is harmless, but it can cause confusion or clutter.

Best Practice:
- You should delete/remove the unused "Certificate Enrollment Request" entry in the Windows Certificate Manager on the app host. This keeps the certificate store clean and avoids confusion.



## Test mtls Validating Mutual TLS Authentication 


### For AMQPS (or similar, like RabbitMQ) with mTLS:

### To summarize:

- **AMQP**: Usually runs on port 5672 (unencrypted).
- **AMQPS**: Runs on port 5671 (TLS-encrypted, often with mTLS).


### 1. **Install OpenSSL for Windows**


### **Server Side**

```bash
openssl s_server -accept 5671 -CAfile C:\path\to\cacert.pem -cert C:\path\to\server.cert.pem -key C:\path\to\server.key.pem -state

# - -accept 5671: Listen on port 5671.- -CAfile: The CA certificate(s) used to verify the client certificate.- -cert and -key: The server’s certificate and private key.- -state: Print detailed state information.
```

### **Client Side**

```bash
openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:5671 -key C:\path\to\client.key.pem -cert C:\path\to\client.cert.pem -CAfile C:\path\to\cacert.pem -state

```

### **For Real AMQPS Servers (like RabbitMQ):**
If you want to test your actual AMQPS broker (not just a simulated server), point the client to the real host:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect your-broker-host:5671 -key C:\path\to\client.key.pem -cert C:\path\to\client.cert.pem -CAfile C:\path\to\cacert.pem -state
```
**Assumptions:**
- your-broker-host is the remote AMQPS server.- The server is configured to require client certificates (mTLS).
- The server's **trust store** contains the CA that signed your client certificate.
- Your client certificate and private key are valid and match, and the cacert.pem you provide to your client contains the CA that signed the server's certificate.
---

## 1. **RabbitMQ Logging:**

- **If the client cert is trusted by RabbitMQ (i.e., signed by a CA in RabbitMQ’s trust store):**
  - **RabbitMQ logs a successful TLS handshake.**
  - However, RabbitMQ expects a proper AMQP protocol handshake after the TLS handshake.
  - Since OpenSSL s_client does not send AMQP frames, after the TLS handshake, RabbitMQ will log an error like:

```log
closing AMQP connection <0.x.x> (127.0.0.1:yyyy -> 127.0.0.1:5671):
missed AMQP 0-9-1 protocol header

```
- But the TLS/mTLS authentication itself is successful.

- **If the client cert is NOT trusted/invalid:**
  - RabbitMQ logs a TLS handshake failure, e.g.:

```log
TLS handshake error: tls_alert_certificate_unknown

```
- No AMQP protocol error, as handshake didn’t complete.

## 2. **OpenSSL s_client Output:**

- **If mTLS handshake is successful:**

```log
Verify return code: 0 (ok)
```
and details about the server’s certificate.

- **If handshake fails (e.g., cert not trusted):**
  - You’ll see an SSL error, such as:

```log
140735206191936:error:14094410:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert handshake failure:ssl/record/rec_layer_s3.c:1543:SSL alert number 40
```

No, running `openssl s_client -connect your-broker-host:5671 ...` to test the AMQPS/mTLS handshake will NOT disturb or interrupt current traffic on your RabbitMQ server.
