You may do this using you favorite text editor or by using the command line.

GUI Text Editor

1. Open All files in a text editor. (Remember, not your domain certificate.)
2. Create a new blank text file.
3. Copy contents of all files in reverse order and paste them into the new file.
Example: Intermediate 3, Intermediate 2, Intermediate 1, Root Certificate.
4. Save newly created file as 'yourDomain.ca-bundle'.

CA-bundle is a file that contains root and intermediate certificates in the right order. The order must be:

- Intermediate CA Certificate 2

- Intermediate CA Certificate 1

- Root CA Certificate


VM1
C:\testca_store\bundle
Directory of C:\testca_store\bundle

02/19/2022  10:39 AM    <DIR>          .
02/19/2022  10:39 AM    <DIR>          ..
02/07/2022  05:18 PM             1,096 ca_certificate.pem
02/17/2022  08:34 PM             1,100 ca_client_certificate.pem

cp 1 ca_client_certificate.pem, 2 ca_certificate.pem notepad save as (.), pdp-shovel-1.ca-bundle

now lets point to that for VM1:

 {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"C:\\testca\\ca_certificate.pem"},
 {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"C:\\testca_store\\bundle\\pdp-shovel-1.ca-bundle"},

and the connection is success

lets to the same on VM2:

 Directory of c:\testca\bundle

02/19/2022  10:52 AM    <DIR>          .
02/19/2022  10:52 AM    <DIR>          ..
02/07/2022  05:18 PM             1,096 ca_certificate.pem
02/17/2022  08:34 PM             1,100 ca_client_certificate.pem

cp 1 ca_certificate.pem 2 ca_client_certificate.pem, notepad save as (.), pdp-shovel-2.ca-bundle

Now lets point to that for VM2:

{ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"C:\\testca\\ca_certificate.pem"},
{ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"C:\\testca\\bundle\\pdp-shovel-2.ca-bundle"},
