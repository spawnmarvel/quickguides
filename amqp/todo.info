Only of use for the amqps scheme and used to configure verification of the server's x509 (TLS) certificate. Note: 
It is highly recommended to use both values. See the TLS guide to learn more about TLS support in RabbitMQ in general and specifically the Erlang client section.

If the option verify is set to verify_peer the option server_name_indication shall also be specified, 
if it is not, no Server Name Indication extension will be sent, and public_key:pkix_verify_hostname/2 
will be called with the IP-address of the connection as ReferenceID, which is probably not what you want.

[...]

When the option verify is set to verify_peer the check public_key:pkix_verify_hostname/2 will be performed in addition 
to the usual x509-path validation checks. If the check fails the error {bad_cert, hostname_check_failed} will be propagated to the path validation fun verify_fun.

For the client, the option {server_name_indication, atom_to_list(TargetNode)} is added when connecting. 
This makes it possible to use the client option {verify, verify_peer}, and the client will verify that the certificate matches the 
node name you are connecting to. This only works if the the server certificate is issued to the name atom_to_list(TargetNode).


For the server it is also possible to use the option {verify, verify_peer} and the server will only accept client connections with 
certificates that are trusted by a root certificate that the server knows. 
A client that presents an untrusted certificate will be rejected. This option is preferably combined with {fail_if_no_peer_cert, true} 
or a client will still be accepted if it does not present any certificate.

1 Test SNI on VM1 
2 Read on shovel properties, view 37 server

%% Rather than specifying some values per-shovel, you can specify
   %% them for all shovels here.

3 Test encode password for certfile

This plugin allows RabbitMQ clients authenticate using x509 certificates and TLS (PKI) peer verification mechanism 
instead of credentials (username/password pairs).



2 OpenSSL client certificate
2.1 Move OpenSSL to VM1 generate CA TestCA2 and client sertificate
2.2:
* Use new client certficate on vm1
* Copy client CA to vm2, since VM1 has server CA, {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,"C:\\testca\\ca_certificate.pem"},
* Set up client equal to server
# mtls

2 OpenSSL server certificate lasting just 1 day
# check connction after expired
